# Nigeria Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Public Dataset

The purpose of this repository is to collate data on the ongoing Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in Nigeria. On 11th of March, 2020, The World Health Organization (WHO) [declared the COVID-19 virus outbreak as a global pandemic](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020). Even though the outbreak originated from Wuhan in China, its spread in Nigeria and across the globe has been very rapid disrupting all human activities and social life. 

This dataset contains the latest available public data on COVID-19 disease in Nigeria. My goal is to record detailed information on confirmed cases of COVID-19 across the nation and produce amazing visual insights that can be used to make informed decisions in the fight against COVID-19 in Nigeria. The data will be obtained from official sources only (e.g. NCDC).

### Data Sources
This dataset is collected from official statements presented by [Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC)](http:covid19.ncdc.gov.ng).

### Update Frequency
I will try my best to update the dataset and produce amazing visualization products as often as necessary (based on the in-flow of new data).

### Contribution
I am hoping that this can become a collaborative and transparent project by some of the best data analysts and scientists in Nigerians. Interested contributors can reach on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kamparia/).

### Data Usage
The dataset is free to use, and share given the appropriate credits are given. [LICENSE](https://github.com/Kamparia/nigeria-covid19-data/blob/master/LICENSE)
